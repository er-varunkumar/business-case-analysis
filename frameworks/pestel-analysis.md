# PESTEL Analysis: Comprehensive Environmental Scanning Framework

## Overview
**PESTEL Analysis** (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal) is a strategic framework used to identify, monitor, and analyze external macro-environmental factors that may impact an organization. Originally developed as PEST (Francis Aguilar, 1967), it has evolved to include Environmental and Legal dimensions, providing a comprehensive view of the business landscape.

*"The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Peter Drucker*

## Framework Components

The PESTEL framework comprises six key dimensions that collectively provide a 360-degree view of the external environment:

- **Political:** Government policies, political stability, trade regulations
- **Economic:** Economic growth, inflation rates, exchange rates
- **Social:** Demographic trends, cultural attitudes, health consciousness
- **Technological:** Innovation, automation, research & development
- **Environmental:** Climate change, sustainability, environmental regulations
- **Legal:** Employment law, consumer protection, health & safety
