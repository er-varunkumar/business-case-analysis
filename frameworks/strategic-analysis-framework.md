# Strategy Analysis Framework (SAF)

A structured, multi-step approach for analyzing a company's strategic position. The models and questions within this framework are designed to stimulate thinking; not all elements will be relevant in every situation. Use the suggested models and questions as a starting point, letting your specific context dictate the right tools for your analysis.

---

## Step 1: Current Company Situation

**Frameworks to Consider:**
*   BLS Analysis
*   BCG Matrix
*   BEP Analysis

### Industry History & Development
Analyze the industry's evolution by charting its critical incidents—those pivotal events that shaped its current state. Consider geographical variations, dominant business-level strategies over time, the effectiveness of broad vs. focused strategies, key marketing decisions, and essential operational competencies. Shifts in industry leadership are also critical. Creating a timeline can be a useful way to organize these events.

### Business-Level Strategy (BLS) Analysis
Identify the company's core BLS: is it a differentiation, low-cost leadership, or integrated strategy? Is it broad or focused? Assess how effectively the company has invested its resources relative to its competitive position. Note if the company employs different BLS across various regions (e.g., low-cost in one market, differentiated in another). Provide a comprehensive account of how the company competes.

### Break-Even Point (BEP) Analysis
The break-even point is the sales volume at which revenue covers all fixed and variable costs.

**Calculation:**
1.  **Contribution Margin (CM):** `CM = P - VC`
    *   Where `P` is unit price and `VC` is variable cost per unit.
2.  **Break-Even Point (BEP):** `BEP = FC / CM`
    *   Where `FC` is total fixed costs.

> **From Investopedia:** An analysis to determine the point at which revenue received equals the costs associated with receiving the revenue. It calculates the **margin of safety**—the amount by which revenue can fall while still staying above the break-even point.

**Outcome of Step 1:** This step provides a broad picture of the company's operations, allowing you to evaluate the profit potential of its strategy and form initial conclusions or recommendations.

## Step 2: External Environment

**Frameworks to Consider:**
*   PESTEL Analysis
*   Porter’s Five Forces
*   Stages of Lifecycle
*   **SWOT Analysis (Emphasis on O & T)**

### Analyze the External Environment
This involves examining the competitor, industry, and general macro-environment to identify opportunities and threats.

*   **Porter's Five Forces:** Assess the industry's attractiveness and profit potential by analyzing:
    1.  Threat of New Entrants
    2.  Bargaining Power of Buyers
    3.  Bargaining Power of Suppliers
    4.  Threat of Substitute Products
    5.  Intensity of Rivalry
*   **Stages of Lifecycle:** Determine the industry's current stage (birth, growth, maturity, revitalization, decline).

### Linking to SWOT
The external analysis directly feeds into the **Opportunities and Threats** portion of a SWOT analysis. If Porter's model reveals significant threats, ask:
*   How can the company counter these threats?
*   How should it adapt its BLS in response?

> **Example: Starbucks SWOT**
> *   **Strength:** Strong brand portfolio (Ethos Water, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana).
> *   **Weakness:** Products are easily imitated; constant pressure on pricing.
> By conducting a SWOT, Starbucks can leverage its strengths to capitalize on opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.

## Step 3: Internal Capabilities

**Frameworks to Consider:**
*   VRIO Analysis
*   P-O-L-C
*   Balanced Scorecard
*   Governance Mechanisms
*   Organization Structure Characteristics
*   Value Chain Analysis
*   **SWOT Analysis (Emphasis on S & W)**

### Value Chain and SWOT Analysis
Use the industry timeline from Step 1 to understand how the company's **Strengths and Weaknesses** have emerged over time. Examine each value chain function (e.g., supply chain, marketing, R&D) to identify areas of current strength and weakness. Support observations with data.

**Key Questions:**
*   What are the company's core competencies?
*   Are they the *right* competencies for its chosen BLS?
*   How can it exploit them further?
*   Can it pursue both low-cost and differentiation simultaneously?

### Analyze Structure and Control Systems
*   **Structure:** Is the company's organizational structure appropriate for its strategy?
*   **Controls:** How effective is the management team? Are reward systems encouraging the right behaviors?
*   **Performance:** Does the company use a tool like the **Balanced Scorecard** to track financial and strategic performance?
*   **Culture:** Analyze the decision-making culture. Are problems due to bad strategy formulation or poor implementation?

Suggest a concrete action plan to address any identified issues.

## Step 4: Identify Key Problems and Opportunities

**Frameworks to Consider:**
*   Price – Cost = Profit
*   SWOT Analysis
*   Organization Controls
*   Type 1, 2, 3 Rivalry
*   Strategy Diamond
*   Action Checklist: Understanding and Managing Competition Over Time

### Prioritize and Focus
With a clear understanding of the external environment and internal capabilities, you must now **summarize and prioritize** your findings.

*   No company has unlimited resources; focus on the most salient issues.
*   Identify the key problems that need solving and the most promising opportunities to pursue.
*   Prioritize your findings so the most critical item is addressed first.

The models listed for this step are designed to help you organize and prioritize effectively before moving to recommendations.

## Step 5: Make Actionable Recommendations

**Guiding Principle:**
*   Rules of Analysis

### Developing High-Quality Recommendations
Recommendations should solve the identified strategic problems and enhance future profitability. They must follow logically from the preceding analysis.

**Actionable recommendations are:**
*   **Specific:** Clearly state what needs to be done.
*   **Measurable:** Define how success will be quantified.
*   **Detailed:** Provide enough detail for implementation (Who? What? By When?).
*   **Credible:** Supported by the evidence presented in your report.
*   **Consistent:** Recommendations should not contradict one another.

Your final plan might include a prioritized timetable that sequences actions from the business level down to the functional level.

### Rules of Analysis
Use these five rules to check the quality of your work:

1.  **Understand the Question:** Ensure your analysis and recommendations directly address the original problem or assignment.
2.  **Essential Vocabulary:** Use industry- and context-specific terminology accurately to demonstrate mastery and credibility.
3.  **Use Evidence:** Support all conclusions and recommendations with specific data and evidence from your analysis. This makes critical feedback more palatable and persuasive.
4.  **Be Complete:** Provide a comprehensive analysis. Know and report your assumptions. While an executive summary is crucial, the full report must stand on its own depth.
5.  **Be Precise:** Edit ruthlessly. Answer the research question fully but omit everything unnecessary. "It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare an impromptu speech." - Mark Twain.
